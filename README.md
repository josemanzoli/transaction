## Installation

### Docker

##### Setup

```
mvn clean install
docker-compose up --build
```

## Executing commands inside the container.
If you want to check out what is inside the container

```
docker ps
```
The result should be like this:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED                  STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
c32dc1bd81ee        transacti           "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8â€¦"   Less than a second ago   Up 2 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   transaction
```

Get the CONTAINER ID and execute this:
```
docker exec -it c32dc1bd81ee /bin/bash
```
That's it, now you can execute commands inside the container.
